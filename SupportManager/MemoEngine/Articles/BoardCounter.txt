특정 테이블의 레코드 카운트를 빨리 가져오기

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/martijnh/archive/2010/07/15/sql-server-how-to-quickly-retrieve-accurate-row-count-for-table.aspx

1 
 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transactions 
 
Performs a full table scan. Slow on large tables. 
 

2 
 
SELECT CONVERT(bigint, rows) 

FROM sysindexes 

WHERE id = OBJECT_ID('Transactions') 

AND indid < 2 
 
Fast way to retrieve row count. Depends on statistics and is inaccurate. 

Run DBCC UPDATEUSAGE(Database) WITH COUNT_ROWS, which can take significant time for large tables. 
 

3 
 
SELECT CAST(p.rows AS float) 

FROM sys.tables AS tbl 

INNER JOIN sys.indexes AS idx ON idx.object_id = tbl.object_id and idx.index_id < 2 

INNER JOIN sys.partitions AS p ON p.object_id=CAST(tbl.object_id AS int) 

AND p.index_id=idx.index_id 

WHERE ((tbl.name=N'Transactions' 

AND SCHEMA_NAME(tbl.schema_id)='dbo')) 
 
The way the SQL management studio counts rows (look at table properties, storage, row count). Very fast, but still an approximate number of rows. 
 

4 
 
SELECT SUM (row_count) 

FROM sys.dm_db_partition_stats 

WHERE object_id=OBJECT_ID('Transactions')    

AND (index_id=0 or index_id=1); 
 
Quick (although not as fast as method 2) operation and equally important, reliable
